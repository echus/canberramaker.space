Canberra's community makerspace.
</blockquote>

<p>
Canberra Makerspace provides ACT residents with a multi-use workshop and meeting space in Giralang. We are a space for makers and aspiring makers of all kinds to meet, share knowledge, and work on projects together. See our <a href="/facilities/">Facilities</a> page for a list of equipment we currently have available for public use.
</p>

<p>
We hold public meetups regularly. These meetups are where we invite you to join us and chat, get help or advice, or use our space to work on your projects. Our current regular opening hours are:
<ul>
  <li>Wednesdays, 6:30pm (electronics)</li>
  <li>Sundays, 1pm-4pm (general making)</li>
</ul>

Other planned events or notifications of the space opening are posted in our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/canberramakerspace">Facebook group</a> as they happen.
</p>

<p>
Our group includes people with diverse backgrounds and interests. We are dedicated to maintaining an inclusive environment for everyone. See our <a href="/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>.
