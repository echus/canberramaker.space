<p>We love seeing new faces and would love for you to come and try out the space to see if it suits you. <b>Your first visit is free.</b></p>

<p>After that, to continue using the space you can either buy a casual day use pass or become a member by paying a monthly fee.</p>

<h2>Why become a member?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Get <b>access</b> to our workshop any time the space is open and use our tools to work on your own projects (see our <a href="/facilities">Facilities</a> page for what we have available)</li>
  <li>Become part of our <b>community</b>, share knowledge, and get support from fellow makers</li>
  <li>Help <b>support</b> Canberraâ€™s only community-led, not-for-profit makerspace - all of our fees go towards paying rent and improving the space and its facilities for our members</li>
  <li>All fee-paying members get <b>voting rights</b> and have a say in the future direction of the space</li>
</ul>
